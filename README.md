## Music - my everpresent hobby.
<br />
Music has always been a huge part of my life. Whenerver I feel sad or stressed, my favourite songs are there to help me get through those moments. I listen to various music genres but my favourite has always been and I think always will be indie/alternative rock. Here are some of the best rock artists that I found so far:
<br />
- Halestorm<br />
- Chevelle<br />
- Cam Cole<br />
- Brkn Love<br />
- Himalayas<br />
